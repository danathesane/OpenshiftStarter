Openshift Pyramid Starter
===

OpenShift caught my attention since the very first time I saw it. However, it was very, very hard to deploy my pyramid app there. I hope this starter help you do it without pain, just do
``` rhc app create <app_name> <cartridges> --from-code=https://github.com/josuemontano/OpenshiftStarter ``` and enjoy!
